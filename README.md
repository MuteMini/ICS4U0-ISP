# Welcome to Bus Conductor!
An ICS ISP made by Min and Ishan.

## What is this?
This driving/puzzle game created by the dynamic duo of Min and Ishan was created specifically for **~marks~** the application of knowledge for the ICS4U0 course. Using a combination of Java AWT and Swing, we created a interesting and *hopefully* a fun game to play. You take on the role of a public transit bus driver in the midst of a world wide pandemic. The game has two main modes, a driving mode where you go from stop to stop picking up passengers, and a puzzle mode where you must fit all your passengers while following social distance guidelines. The game has 40+ levels, and the puzzles get progressively more difficult!

## How do I play it?
The most current jar file, along with the other beta test releases, is placed in the [**Releases**](https://github.com/MuteMini/ICS4U0-ISP/releases) tab. To run it, you can either double click or in command prompt type:
``` java jar _PATH_TO_JAR_FILE_ .jar ```

Have fun!
